        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A light delicious cake from the BBC Good Food site</p>
        <p>The cake is amazingly moist and not too sweet. It also freezes well.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>225g unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>225g caster sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
            <strong>For the drizzle topping</strong>
            <li>1Â½ lemons, juiced </li>
            <li>85g caster sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemon juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle - the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.
            </li>
        </ol>
